  var body = "Hello,\n\nI support an immediate and lasting ceasefire, echoing the position of 45 Congress members and a two-thirds majority of American voters according to a recent Data for Progress poll.\n\nAs your constituent and an advocate for the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR), I urge you to take swift action. Call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire, facilitate the unimpeded entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza, and staunchly oppose any further endorsement of violence by arming the Israeli military. Endorse and co-sponsor the Ceasefire Now resolution, H.Res. 786, championed by Rep. Cori Bush.\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that a mere four-day pause in Israel's bombings does not constitute a ceasefire; rather, it perpetuates a cycle of genocide. Recent legal advisories warn of potential consequences for aiding genocide through congressional acts, exemplified by a lawsuit where Palestinians are holding President Biden accountable. The situation in Gaza demands immediate attention, with over 2.2 million lives at stake and a death toll exceeding 24,000 Palestinians, including over 11,000 children and more than 30,000 wounded. Hospitals, refugee camps, schools, and religious sites are under constant attack, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe urgency to halt these atrocities cannot be overstated. I implore you to champion de-escalation efforts by demanding an immediate and permanent ceasefire, pressuring Israel to facilitate humanitarian aid entry into Gaza, and refraining from providing additional weaponry or funding to the Israeli military. For too long, Israel has engaged in genocidal massacres against Palestinians in Gaza. The Biden administration's commitment to increased military support perpetuates this cycle. I reject complacency and urge tangible policy changes to prioritize justice over politics-as-usual..\n\nThank you,\n\n"+name+"\n\n"+address;
